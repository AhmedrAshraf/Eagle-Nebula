A startup studio is different.
It''s a startup factory where ideas become companies side‑by‑side with experienced entrepreneurs.

Where we stand apart: many incubators, accelerators, and VCs chase numbers only—growth charts, user counts, revenue graphs. They treat passion as "nice to have" and ignore the new wave of founders: content creators, solopreneurs, freeLancers, influencers, creatives, coaches, personal brands —people building in completely new ways.

At Eagle Nebula, we start with you. We design a business around your passion, your skills, and the way you work best—then co‑found it with you.

From day one you''re inside our Design Your Business with AI methodology, supported by a community of like‑minded founders, seasoned coaches, and a co‑founder who''s invested in your success.

We don''t just coach.
We co‑create, co‑own, and co‑launch.', NOW(), NOW()),

Most founders start from the outside: "What''s trending? What''s profitable?"
We flip it. Start from inside—with founder fit—and then build outward. When the founder fits the market, the product becomes clear.

The Five Pillars:
• What You Love – Your passion foundation. The fuel that keeps you going.
• What You Have – Skills, experience, relationships, and assets already in your hands.
• Your Best Way to Work – How you operate at your best (pace, role, environment, solo/team).
• What You Want to Achieve – Your goals, outcomes, and the life you''re building toward.
• Your AI Co‑Builder – Your speed advantage that makes the journey easier and faster (idea testing, content, research, automation, ops).

The Sweet Spot: where all five overlap.
You love it. You''re equipped for it. It fits your style. It moves you toward your goals. And AI makes building easier and faster than ever.

This is not a course. It''s a build system—used live, in the studio, to turn your founder DNA into a company.', NOW(), NOW()),
