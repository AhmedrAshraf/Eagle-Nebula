    "description": "Most people think starting a business means figuring it out alone—or joining an incubator that only teaches theory.\n\nA startup studio is different.\nIt's a startup factory where ideas become companies side‑by‑side with experienced entrepreneurs.\n\nWhere we stand apart: many incubators, accelerators, and VCs chase numbers only—growth charts, user counts, revenue graphs. They treat passion as \"nice to have\" and ignore the new wave of founders: content creators, solopreneurs, freeLancers, influencers, creatives, coaches, personal brands —people building in completely new ways.\n\nAt Eagle Nebula, we start with you. We design a business around your passion, your skills, and the way you work best—then co‑found it with you.\n\nFrom day one you're inside our Design Your Business with AI methodology, supported by a community of like‑minded founders, seasoned coaches, and a co‑founder who's invested in your success.\n\nWe don't just coach.\nWe co‑create, co‑own, and co‑launch."

    "title": "Design Your Business with AI",

    "description": "(The operating system of Eagle Nebula)\n\nMost founders start from the outside: \"What's trending? What's profitable?\"\nWe flip it. Start from inside—with founder fit—and then build outward. When the founder fits the market, the product becomes clear.\n\nThe Five Pillars:\n• What You Love – Your passion foundation. The fuel that keeps you going.\n• What You Have – Skills, experience, relationships, and assets already in your hands.\n• Your Best Way to Work – How you operate at your best (pace, role, environment, solo/team).\n• What You Want to Achieve – Your goals, outcomes, and the life you're building toward.\n• Your AI Co‑Builder – Your speed advantage that makes the journey easier and faster (idea testing, content, research, automation, ops).\n\nThe Sweet Spot: where all five overlap.\nYou love it. You're equipped for it. It fits your style. It moves you toward your goals. And AI makes building easier and faster than ever.\n\nThis is not a course. It's a build system—used live, in the studio, to turn your founder DNA into a company."

We don't need a perfect idea—we need a spark.\n\nStep 2 — Discovery: We run the Design Your Business with AI process to map your founder profile (love, assets, work‑style, goals). You're the center of the design.\n\nStep 3 — Co‑Founding Sprint: We sit at the same table and build: brainstorm, validate, name, position, prototype—using AI for faster testing and execution.\n\nStep 4 — The Eagle Nebula Ecosystem: Join a supportive community of passionate Saudi founders, coaches, and operators. Share wins, ask real questions, get real answers.\n\nStep 5 — Launch & Grow: We launch together. We stand with you in operations, content, and growth. We share the risk—and the reward."
